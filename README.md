<h3> How To Play (4 - 8   Player Game) </h2>



<p> Two teams compete by each having a "spymaster" give one-word clues with a number that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the sane team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. First team to guess all of their words wins. To see the full complete set of rules please refer to https://howdoyouplayit.com/codename-rules-how-do-you-play-the-codename-board-game/ <p>

<h3>Getting Started:</h3> 


<p><strong>Here is the link to the game!</strong><p>
https://samostrom.github.io/CodeNames/


<p>A couple things to note - 
You will need to change turns when your turn is over manually by clicking on the change turn button. The current team's turn is displayed on the top right of the board. 

When inputting your code word and number for the number of words correlated to your code word, be sure your teams turn is displayed before hitting submit. Otherwise, your clue will go in the wrong teams column.

The SpyMaster peek button is a toggle switch for the spymasters to continue to light up the board to see which words correlate with each color. 

The first team to start will always be red. There are 8 red squares and 7 blue squares. There is also a black square that if hit, that team automatically loses.

The winner will be display up at the top right corner of the board, taking the place of the teams turn.

If you want to start a New Game, press the New Game Button up at the top right corner of the screen. </p>





<h3> Planned Future Enhancements </h3>

<p> 

- Have Code Word and Guesses Box reset to empty

- Turns are automatically changed based off of number of guesses and whether teammates guessed right or wrong. 

- Change layout for media screen sizes

- Background Colors for tiles when clicked upon (they are too bright on the eyes)

- Guess and Code Word entry box only allow certain inputs

- Add additional parameters to prevent invalid clues: no pronouns, acronyms, etc

- Clicking on boxes after games end and before New Game does not work

- make winning more apparent

- Additional "effects" to make game look and feel cleaner

- Finally, make it available to be played online on teams. Spymasters will be the only players to have access to the spymaster peek button and the submit fields. Non spymasters will be able to click on the board to reveal colors. Teams will not be able to click on anything until their turn.
